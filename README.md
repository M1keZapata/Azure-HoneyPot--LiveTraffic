<h2>Project Walkthrough</h2>
<h3>Microsoft Azure: Creating a Virtual Machine</h3>
<p>Through Microsoft Azure I was able to quickly create and access machines that I can intentionally make susceptible to virtual attacks [i.e. a honeypot]. I created this virtual machine to run Windows 10, allow port 3389 access, and defaulted to all other minimal security settings available within this Azure account. </p>

<h3>Windows Virtual Machine: Inviting Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>To ensure my virtual machine became a tempting target for malicious activity I remoted into my created virtual machine using RDP to disable the domain, public, and private firewalls within Windows Firewall with Advanced Security(wf.msc). <br><br>I signed out of my honeypot to test whether or not it was indeed logging suspicious activity. I then intentionally input incorrect credentials when remoting into my honeypot before then inserting correct ones. To confirm malicious activity I was able to locate information around my incorrect login within the Event Viewer <i>[Start Menu > Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security]</i>.</p>
