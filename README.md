<h1>Azure Honeypot Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This project demonstrates the process of how I was able to log and visualize malicious attacks to Windows Virtual Machine created in Microsoft Azure
</b>
<!-- <br />
<br />
The script is used in this demo where I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot.
We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to
look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map!
